Our final product included two applications, one being the JavaCV version,
and the other being the Android Client-Server Model. 

\paragraph{JavaCV version} Demo was able to rotate and segment characters
using the Android platform and JavaCV. It then implemented our correlation template
matching for deduce the characters on screen.

\paragraph{Android Client Server} Demo was running using a trained SVM on
the local computer. As shown in class, and during the demonstration, the SVM
was able to classify text correctly, with noise, and rotation.
